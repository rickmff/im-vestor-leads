# IM-VESTOR

Leads marketplace that connects **entrepreneurs** and **investors**. Members
browse and unlock leads, send introduction *pokes*, chat in real time, and pay
for credits and memberships through Stripe.

## What the platform does

- **Leads marketplace** — entrepreneurs and investors discover each other from a
  shared dashboard. Investor profiles carry an investment capacity and sectors
  of interest; entrepreneur profiles surface their venture.
- **Real-time messaging** — conversations, unread counts and notifications sync
  live over Supabase Realtime.
- **Shop & wallet** — three things are purchasable through Stripe Checkout:
  - **Pokes** — introduction currency used to reach another member.
  - **Lead credits** — each one unlocks a lead's full profile, media and chat.
  - **Memberships** — monthly / annual subscriptions for full marketplace access.
  - Balances and subscription state live on the user's profile; billing
    (card, invoices, cancellation) is handled by the Stripe billing portal.
- **Referrals** — every user gets a referral code and can credit a referrer at
  sign-up.

## Getting started

Prerequisites: [Bun](https://bun.sh), a PostgreSQL database, and Clerk, Supabase
and Stripe projects.

```bash
bun install                       # installs deps; postinstall runs `prisma generate`
cp .env.example .env              # then fill in the values (see below)
bunx prisma migrate dev           # apply the schema to your database
bun dev                           # http://localhost:3000
```

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` and fill these in:

- **Clerk** — `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`.
- **Database** — `DATABASE_URL` (pooled), `DIRECT_URL` (direct, for migrations).
- **Supabase** — `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.
- **Stripe** — `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`,
  `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and one price id per product
  (`STRIPE_PRICE_SUBSCRIPTION_MONTHLY/ANNUAL`, `STRIPE_PRICE_POKE_PACK_3/5/10`,
  `STRIPE_PRICE_LEAD_CREDIT`).

The shop boots without Stripe keys — products just show as "Coming soon" until
the matching price ids are set. Full setup walkthrough: [`docs/STRIPE_SHOP_SETUP.md`](docs/STRIPE_SHOP_SETUP.md).
